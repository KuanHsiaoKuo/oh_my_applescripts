# Task Shuffle

I've found that reviewing my idea lists generates more and new ideas if I can shuffle the tasks within a given project. So that's what this does. Select a project or projects and run this script to shuffle the tasks within each project.

# Which File?

You'll find two versions of the script - `.scpt` and `.applescript`. In order to run it from OmniFocus, you'll want to use the `.scpt` version. The `.applescript` format is purely there so you can view the code online.

# Development

I'm certainly open to the submission of Pull Requests to make this better. If you find issues and fix them, please let me know and I'll be happy to update and give you credit.
